- Implements upgrade mechanisms while maintaining the state.

### Attributes

- Current Version
- Upgradable Contracts Addresses

### Functions

- upgradeContract()
- getCurrentVersion()

### Events

- ContractUpgraded

## Interaction and Integration

- These contracts are designed to interact seamlessly and comprehensively to represent the cumulative state, attributes, and visual representation of the NFT.
- The Base NFT contract should synchronize with other contracts to reflect any changes in the attributes and visual representation.

## Security and Testing

- Every contract module must undergo rigorous testing and auditing to ensure the security and integrity of the system.
- Special attention must be given to the interactions between contracts to avoid any vulnerabilities or inconsistencies.

## Gas Efficiency and Optimization

- Each contract and interaction must be optimized for gas efficiency to minimize the cost of transactions and contract deployments.
- Redundant interactions and data storages must be avoided, and data structures should be optimized for minimal gas usage.

## Documentation

- Comprehensive documentation must be maintained for each contract detailing its purpose, functionalities, interactions, and any known limitations or considerations.

## Upgrades and Modifications

- The system must be designed to accommodate future upgrades and modifications without compromising the existing functionalities and data.
- The upgradeability contract should manage any updates in a secure and transparent manner, ensuring the integrity of the system.
