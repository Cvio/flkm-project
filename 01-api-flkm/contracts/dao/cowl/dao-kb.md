# Decentralized Knowledge Evolution (DKE) Overview

This contract represents a decentralized platform for the evolution of knowledge where users can contribute knowledge, propose modifications, and vote on them. Knowledge is structured within clusters, and each piece of knowledge and modification proposal can be supported or enacted, with rewards for participation.

## State Variables
- `rewardToken` (IERC20): Token used to reward users.
- `nextClusterID` (uint256): ID to be assigned to the next knowledge cluster.
- `nextKnowledgeID` (uint256): ID to be assigned to the next contributed knowledge.
- `nextIdeaID` (uint256): ID to be assigned to the next growth idea.
- `rewardAmount` (uint256): Amount of reward tokens assigned for certain actions.
- `modificationVoteRequirement` (uint256): Minimum number of votes required to modify content.
- `modificationApprovalThreshold` (uint256): Threshold for modification proposals to be approved.
- `authorRewardAmount` (uint256): Amount of reward tokens assigned to the author of knowledge.
- `voterRewardAmount` (uint256): Amount of reward tokens assigned to voters.

## Structs
### Knowledge
- Represents a piece of knowledge with:
  - `author`: The address of the author.
  - `content`: The content of knowledge.
  - `upvotes`: The number of upvotes received.
  - `clusterID`: The associated cluster ID.

### GrowthIdea
- Represents a growth idea with:
  - `initiator`: The address of the initiator.
  - `idea`: Description of the idea.
  - `requiredFunds`: Funds required to enact the idea.
  - `supportVotes`: Number of support votes received.
  - `fundsPledged`: Funds that have been pledged.
  - `enacted`: Whether the idea has been enacted or not.
  - `clusterID`: The associated cluster ID.

### ModificationProposal
- Represents a modification proposal with:
  - `knowledgeId`: The ID of the associated knowledge.
  - `proposer`: The address of the proposer.
  - `newContent`: The proposed new content.
  - `votes`: The number of votes received.

## Mappings
- `knowledgeBase`: Stores Knowledge structs, accessible by their ID.
- `growthIdeas`: Stores GrowthIdea structs, accessible by their ID.
- `totalResourcesPerCluster`: Stores the total resources/funds per cluster, accessible by clusterID.
- `rewards`: Stores the pending rewards for each address.
- `knowledgeVoters`: Keeps track of users who have voted on a piece of knowledge.
- `proposalVoters`: Keeps track of users who have voted on a modification proposal.
- `modificationProposals`: An array storing all Modification Proposals.

## Events
- `KnowledgeAdded`: Emitted when new knowledge is added.
- `GrowthIdeaProposed`: Emitted when a new growth idea is proposed.
- `GrowthIdeaSupported`: Emitted when a growth idea is supported.
- `GrowthIdeaEnacted`: Emitted when a growth idea is enacted.
- `ModificationProposed`: Emitted when a new modification is proposed.
- `ModificationImplemented`: Emitted when a modification is implemented.

## Functions
1. **initiateKnowledgeCluster** - Initiates a new knowledge cluster. (onlyOwner)
2. **contributeKnowledge** - Allows a user to contribute new knowledge to a cluster.
3. **upvoteKnowledge** - Allows a user to upvote a piece of knowledge.
4. **supportGrowthIdea** - Allows a user to support a growth idea with pledged funds.
5. **enactGrowthIdea** - Enacts a growth idea if the required funds have been pledged. (onlyOwner)
6. **proposeModification** - Allows a user to propose a modification to existing knowledge.
7. **voteOnModification** - Allows a user to vote on a proposed modification.
8. **implementModification** - Implements a modification if it has received sufficient votes.
9. **claimRewards** - Allows a user to claim their pending rewards.
10. **updateParameter** - Allows the owner to update certain parameters like `rewardAmount` and `modificationVoteRequirement`.

## Modifiers
- `onlyOwner`: Restricts access to only the owner of the contract.
- `nonReentrant`: Prevents reentrancy attacks.

## Security
The contract employs `ReentrancyGuard` to prevent reentrancy attacks and `Ownable` to restrict access to certain functions to the owner only.
