# DataStakingContract Knowledge Base

## Overview
`DataStakingContract` facilitates users to stake unique tokens (NFTs) to earn rewards over time, in a specified reward token. It particularly focuses on staking NFTs related to datasets, hinting at a data marketplace scenario.

## Inherited Smart Contracts

### 1. **Initializable** (from OpenZeppelin)
   - Ensures a single call to the `initialize` function for initial contract setup.
   - Replaces constructor functionality for upgradeable contracts.

### 2. **AccessControlUpgradeable** (from OpenZeppelin)
   - Manages access permissions for contract functionalities.
   - Enables role-based access control, defining roles like `ADMIN_ROLE`.

### 3. **ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable** (from OpenZeppelin)
   - Secures against reentrancy attacks by preventing nested function calls.

## Interface

- **IDatasetNFTContract**
  - Ensures compatibility with the contract of staked NFTs.

## Variables

1. **ADMIN_ROLE**
   - Unique identifier for admin role.
2. **rewardToken**
   - Token in which rewards are paid (ERC-20).
3. **datasetNFTContract**
   - Contract of stakable NFTs.
4. **rewardRate**
   - Rate of reward token per second per staked NFT.
5. **bonusRate**
   - An unused variable meant for potential reward adjustments.
6. **stakes**
   - Maps an address to an array of `Stake` structs, each representing an NFT stake.

## Struct

- **Stake**
  - **tokenId**: Identifier for the staked NFT.
  - **timestamp**: Block timestamp representing when it was staked.

## Events

1. **Staked**
   - Emitted when a token is staked.
2. **Unstaked**
   - Emitted upon unstaking with the reward amount.
3. **RewardRateChanged**
   - Emitted when the reward rate is changed.
4. **BonusRateChanged**
   - Emitted when the unused `bonusRate` is changed.

## Functions

### Public/External

1. **initialize**
   - Sets initial contract state.
2. **stake**
   - Enables a user to stake an NFT.
3. **unstake**
   - Permits unstaking of an NFT and claims rewards.
4. **setRewardRate**
   - Admin function to adjust `rewardRate`.
5. **setBonusRate**
   - Admin function to adjust the unused `bonusRate`.

### Internal/Private

1. **_removeStake**
   - Removes an NFT from the stakerâ€™s array of staked tokens.
2. **_calculateReward**
   - Computes the reward for a staked NFT.

## Modifiers

- **onlyAdmin**
  - Restricts function calls to admin users.

## Suggested Changes

1. **Remove Unused Variables**: Evaluate necessity of `bonusRate`.
2. **Optimize for Gas**: Review loops in `_calculateReward` and `_removeStake`.
3. **Use SafeMath**: Ensure safe arithmetic operations.
4. **Enhance Code Structure**: Use custom modifiers for clarity and DRY compliance.
5. **Implement Fallback**: Add function to retrieve erroneously sent tokens.
6. **Testing**: Rigorously test and consider a professional audit.
7. **Improve Documentation**: Enhance inline comments for clarity.
